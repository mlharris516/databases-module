EXERCISES

1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

    INSERT INTO - add new
    UPDATE - modify existing
    DELETE - delete data


2. Explain the structure for each type of command.

    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

        After the INSERT INTO command, specify the table you would like to add to, and the columns you will be adding to if you are not adding values to all columns.
        Next, after the VALUES command, specify the new values you would like to insert, in the order of the columns.

    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2,...
    WHERE condition;

        After the UPDATE command, specify the table you'd like to work on. 
        Next, after the SET command, specify the column(s) and value(s) you'd like to update. 
        Next, use the WHILE command to specify a condition to further narrow down what you will be changing. 

    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

        After the DELETE FROM command, specify the table from which you are deleting data.
        Next, use the WHERE command to specify the condition that narrows down what you are looking to delete. Otherwise, omit this, and delete the whole table.

3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.

    Numbers -  int - 45 - number of items in inventory
    Text - CHAR - Meredith - first name of employee
    Date & Time - DATE - 1991-05-16 - birthdate of customer for rewards program

4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

    CREATE TABLE DinnerGuests (
        ID integer,
        FirstName text,
        LastName text,
        RSVP boolean,
        NumberOfGuests integer,
        NumberOfMeals decimal
    );


    Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.

        ALTER TABLE DinnerGuests
        ADD ThankYouCard boolean;
    
    
    You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.

        CREATE TABLE DinnerMeals (ID, FirstName, LastName, NumberOfMeals);

        INSERT INTO DinnerMeals (ID, FirstName, LastName, NumberOfMeals)
        SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, #ofMeals FROM DinnerGuests;

        ALTER TABLE DinnerGuests
        DROP COLUMN NumberOfMeals;

    
    The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.

        ALTER TABLE DinnerGuests
        ADD TableNumber integer;


    The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.

        ALTER TABLE DinnerGuests
        DROP COLUMN TableNumber;


5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

    CREATE TABLE LibraryBooks (
        ISBN char,
        Title text,
        Author text,
        Genre text,
        PublishingDate date,
        TotalCopies integer,
        AvailableCopies integer,
    );

    Find three books and add their information to the table.

        INSERT INTO LibraryBooks
        VALUES ('9786070712715', 'The Hobbit', 'J.R.R. Tolkien', 'Fantasy', 1937/11/21, 12, 9);

        INSERT INTO LibraryBooks
        VALUES ('9395802932906', 'The Eye of the World', 'Robert Jordan', 'Fantasy', 1990/11/15, 3, 3);

        INSERT INTO LibraryBooks
        VALUES ('8903949692043', 'The Berenstain Bears in the Dark', 'Jan and Stan Berenstain', 'Children's Literature', 1982/8/12, 2, 0);


    Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.

        UPDATE LibraryBooks
        SET AvailableCopies = 2
        WHERE ISBN = '9395802932906';


    Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.

        DELETE FROM LibraryBooks WHERE ISBN = '8903949692043';

    
    
6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. 

    CREATE TABLE Spacecrafts (
        ID integer,
        Name text,
        YearLaunched integer,
        OriginCountry text,
        MissionDescription text,
        OrbitingBody text,
        CurrentlyOperating boolean,
        MilesFromEarth bigint,
    );


In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

    Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.

        INSERT INTO Spacecrafts
        VALUES ('5167', 'The Orbiter', 1976, 'United States', 'Explore space and orbit stuff and things.', 'Jupiter', True, 365,000,000);

        INSERT INTO Spacecrafts
        VALUES ('28579', 'The Disappointment', 1990, 'Antarctica', 'Be the best  Spacecraft.', 'Mercury', True, 48,000,000);

        INSERT INTO Spacecrafts
        VALUES ('918', 'VladShip', 1991, 'Russia', 'Explore space better, and orbit more stuff and more things.', 'Pluto', True, 4,067,000,000);



    Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.

        DELETE FROM Spacecrafts WHERE ID = '28579';


    Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.

        UPDATE Spacecrafts
        SET CurrentlyOperating = False
        WHERE ID = '918';



7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in.

    CREATE TABLE EmailInbox (
        ID integer,
        SubjectLine text,
        Sender text,
        AdditionalRecipients text,
        Body text,
        TimeStamp timestamp,
        Read boolean,
        ChainID integer
    );



Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

    Add three new emails to the inbox.

        INSERT INTO EmailInbox
        VALUES (14, 'Hello', 'me@gmail.com', 'deb@gmail.com', 'Hello, how are you?', 2016-06-05 04:38:56.157, True, 5960);

        INSERT INTO EmailInbox
        VALUES (2, 'Per my last email', patricia@work.com, null, 'I already told you to read the memo on bringing your cat to work.', 2019-05-26 03:45:20.156, False, 29018);

        INSERT INTO EmailInbox
        VALUES (596, 'Fire Sale!', 'boutique@moneymoney.com', 'patricia@work.com', 'OH MY GOD THERE'S A FIRE sale.', 2018-01-01 08:04:59.001, True, 598);


    You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.

        DELETE FROM EmailInbox WHERE ID = '596';


    You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.

        UPDATE EmailInbox
        SET Read = False
        WHERE ID = '2';
